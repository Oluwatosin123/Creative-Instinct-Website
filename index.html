            <h3>HTML5 Mockup</h3>
            <p>
              HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML.
              The term represents two different concepts.
              It is a new version of the language HTML,
              with new elements, attributes, and behaviors,
              and a larger set of technologies that allows the building of more
              diverse and powerful Web sites and applications.

            <h3>CSS3 Styling</h3>
            <p>
              CSS3 is the latest evolution of the
              Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.
              It brings a lot of long-awaited novelties, like rounded corners,
              shadows, gradients, transitions or animations,
              as well as new layouts like multi-columns,
              flexible box or grid layouts.

            <h3>UI/UX Designs</h3>
            <p>
              UX design refers to user experience design,
              while UI design stands for user interface design.
              Both of these are crucial to an IT product and need to work
              closely together. Despite being very integral to each other,
              the roles themselves are quite different,
              involving distinct processes
